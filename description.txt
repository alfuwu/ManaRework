Mana Rework is a modification that makes certain items use some mana, similar to how they worked in Terraria 1.0.

Actual description TBD.

Possibly will rework mana as a resource, making mana potions more valuable & situational than just "ammunition" to mages.

Oh, also, this mod makes mana stars five times more expensive, so they're actually difficult to get.
